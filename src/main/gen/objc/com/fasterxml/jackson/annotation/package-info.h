 @brief Public core annotations, most of which are used to configure how
  Data Mapping/Binding works.Annotations in this package can only
  have dependencies to non-annotation classes in Core package;
  annotations that have dependencies to Mapper classes are included
  in Mapper module (under <code>org.codehaus.jackson.map.annotate</code>).
 Also contains parameter types (mostly enums) needed by annotations.
 <p>
  Note that prior versions (1.x) contained these annotations within
  'core' jar, as part of Streaming API.
